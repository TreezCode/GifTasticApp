# GifTasticApp

Overview

This application uses jQuery to dynamically populate buttons to the screen from a predefined array of strings. The user is able to create new buttons via an input text field.

When a button is clicked, the app will send an AJAX call to the GIPHY API and return a JSON response object. The app will parse through the response and render certain properties to the screen using jQuery for DOM manipulation.
